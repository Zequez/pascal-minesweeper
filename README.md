### Pascal Minesweeper

*This is not a render, this is an actual in-game picture!*

So, I had to study for a Pascal test. Yes, in Argentina we are taught Pascal on *Programming 101*. I'm not sure why, since the language is freaking archaic and is not used ANYWHERE. But I guess is a good introduction to low-level programming, although I would rather learn C, since it has more real-world uses.

Anyway, so I had to study for a Pascal test, and after skiming over the topics I though it would be more fun to make a game than to make pointless exercises.

I could have used more structures, but I didn't realize until after being knee-deep into the thing. So anyway, here it is.
