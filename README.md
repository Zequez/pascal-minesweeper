### Pascal Minesweeper

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

*This is not a render, this is an actual in-game picture!*

So, I had to study for a Pascal test. Yes, in Argentina we are taught Pascal on *Programming 101*. I'm not sure why, since the language is freaking archaic and is not used ANYWHERE. But I guess is a good introduction to low-level programming, although I would rather learn C, since it has more real-world uses.

Anyway, so I had to study for a Pascal test, and after skimming over the topics I though it would be more fun to make a game than to make pointless exercises.

I could have used more structures, but I didn't realize until after being knee-deep into the thing. So anyway, here it is.

### Instructions

* Move with `ARROW` keys
* Set flags with `F` key
* Activate tile with `SPACE` key
* Quit the current minefield with `Q`

### Features

* 4 levels of difficulty!
* You can set flags!
* Colors!
* It displays all the mines when you lose!
* Satisfying start! Because it makes sure all the tiles are clear on the first try!
* Memory leaks! Overflows of many kinds!
* Retro 8-bit console pixel-art gameplay!
* Buzzwords!
* Configurable style! Just click on the console `window > Propreties > Font` and change the font size!
