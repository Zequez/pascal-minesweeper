### Pascal Minesweeper

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

*This is not a render, this is an actual in-game picture!*

So, I had to study for a Pascal test. Yes, in Argentina we are taught Pascal on *Programming 101*. I'm not sure why, since the language is freaking archaic and is not used ANYWHERE. But I guess is a good introduction to low-level programming, although I would rather learn C, since it has more real-world uses.

Anyway, so I had to study for a Pascal test, and after skimming over the topics I though it would be more fun to make a game than to make pointless exercises.

I could have used more structures, but I didn't realize until after being knee-deep into the thing. So anyway, here it is.

### Instructions

* Move with arrow keys
* Set flags with F key
* Activate tile with SPACE key

### Issues

I'm pretty sure the algorithm to check for adjacent tiles is aberrantly inneficient, because if I set the minefield to 23x179, I get a runtime error

### Licence

WTFPL
